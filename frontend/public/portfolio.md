Second semester of my Bachlor 2MCT Next Web Developer we got assigned an Industry Project.
For this project we had to work in a team of 3 people we had to make a PWA for a Belgian company.
Our PWA is used to control the football scoreboard in KM Torhout - "Velodroom".

In the 2nd semester of my Bachlor 1MCT Next Web Developer we got assigned a project.
For this project we had to make an IoT device that could be controlled by a webapp.
I chose to make a NeoPixel lamp.

# Electronic "Game" Project - Reactors

[img]: /img/portfolio/IMG_20201214_232454.jpg

In the 1st semester of my Bachlor 1MCT Next Web Developer I made a game.
This was a simple single player game where you had to manage energy demand in a city.
If you supplied too much energy the city would explode.
If you supplied too little energy the city would freeze.

This project involved a lot of electronics and programming.
I also had to hand-solder 2 LED matrices.

# GiP - Smart Power Sockets

[img]: /img/portfolio/unknown-6.png

Senior year of High School I made a thesis project in the field of electronics.
I made a smart power socket that could be controlled by a Progressive Web App.
I also added a voice controlled command system.
Each socket also included an IR transmitter that could be used to control a TV.
There was also an energy meter that could be used to measure the voltage, powerconsumption, cosphi of the socket.
Aswell as a NeoPixel that could be used to show the powerconsumption of the socket.

# Robocontest - Autonomous Line Following Racecar

In Senior year of High School I made a line following racecar.
This racecar was made for the Robocontest 2019.
The racecar had to be able to follow a white line on a fuzzy black background.
It was also required to be able to detect holes in the line and to be able to drive over them.
Sadly the competition was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

# Weather Station

In my sophomore year of High School I made a weather station.
This weather station could measure temperature, humidity and lux.
It also connected to a weather API to get the current weather.
This data was then displayed on an E-Ink display.
The weather station also published the data to an MQTT broker and had its own API.
With this API I made a Web App that could be used to view the data.

# Remote Relay

In my sophomore year of High School I made a remote relay.
I made this out of frustration because the many remotes I had to use at the time.
This remote relay could be controlled by a Progressive Web App.
It could learn IR codes and could be used to control a TV or LED strips.
The UI was basic but it worked.
