# Bachelorthesis - Digital Signage

[img]: /img/portfolio/IMG_4195.jpg

I have written my thesis in Dutch, and my research question is "Hoe maken we een Digital Signage platform op basis van de Raspberry PI & Svelte?" This translates to "How do we make a Digital Signage platform based on the Raspberry PI & Svelte?"

In my thesis, I extensively explore the topic of Digital Signage, including existing players in the field. The main focus is on developing a robust and scalable Digital Signage platform. Throughout the 70-page write-up, I discuss various aspects related to this topic.

Additionally, I address the issue of the shortage of Raspberry Pi devices and highlight the advantages and capabilities of Svelte in the context of developing the platform.

# The Collective - My Machine

[img]: /img/portfolio/mymachine.webp

We are working on a new project for a company called My Machine.
It is a Belgian company that lets children dream of a whacky machine that can do anything. We are challenged to design a one.
After a few workshops and brainstorming sessions we came up with a few ideas.
But we decided to go with the idea of a "companion dragon". This dragon is a friend that can help kids when they are not feeling well.
We also maintained a blog on the company's website where we posted our progress and our thoughts.
