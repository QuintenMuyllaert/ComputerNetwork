# The Collective - My Machine

[img]: /img/portfolio/mymachine.webp

We are working on a new project for a company called My Machine.
It is a Belgian company that lets children dream of a whacky machine that can do anything. We are challenged to design a one.

# Industry Project - DLC Scoreboard

[img]: /img/portfolio/IMG_20220623_140823.jpg

Second semester of my Bachlor 2MCT Next Web Developer we got assigned an Industry Project.
For this project we had to work in a team of 3 people we had to make a PWA for a Belgian company.
Our PWA is used to control the football scoreboard in KM Torhout - "Velodroom".

In the 2nd semester of my Bachlor 1MCT Next Web Developer we got assigned a project.
For this project we had to make an IoT device that could be controlled by a webapp.
I chose to make a NeoPixel lamp.

# Electronic "Game" Project - Reactors

[img]: /img/portfolio/IMG_20201214_232454.jpg

In the 1st semester of my Bachlor 1MCT Next Web Developer I made a game.
This was a simple single player game where you had to manage energy demand in a city.
If you supplied too much energy the city would explode.
If you supplied too little energy the city would freeze.

This project involved a lot of electronics and programming.
I also had to hand-solder 2 LED matrices.

# GiP - Smart Power Sockets

[img]: /img/portfolio/IMG_20191213_091226.jpg

Senior year of High School I made a thesis project in the field of electronics.
I made a smart power socket that could be controlled by a Progressive Web App.
I also added a voice controlled command system.
Each socket also included an IR transmitter that could be used to control a TV.
There was also an energy meter that could be used to measure the voltage, powerconsumption, cosphi of the socket.
Aswell as a NeoPixel that could be used to show the powerconsumption of the socket.

# Robocontest - Autonomous Line Following Racecar

[img]: /img/portfolio/IMG_20181122_171443.jpg

In Senior year of High School I made a line following racecar.
This racecar was made for the Robocontest 2019.
The racecar had to be able to follow a white line on a fuzzy black background.
It was also required to be able to detect holes in the line and to be able to drive over them.
Sadly the competition was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In my free time I made a music visualizer.
This music visualizer was made in Electron and uses the Web Audio API to get the audio data from the computer. The animation is made with p5.js.

# Weather Station

[img]: /img/portfolio/IMG_20191218_214336.jpg

In my sophomore year of High School I made a weather station.
This weather station could measure temperature, humidity and lux.
It also connected to a weather API to get the current weather.
This data was then displayed on an E-Ink display.
The weather station also published the data to an MQTT broker and had its own API.
With this API I made a Web App that could be used to view the data.

# Music Sharing App

[img]: /img/portfolio/IMG_20190519_162911.jpg

I made a webapp that lets you listen to music with your friends.
You can create a room and share the room code with your friends.
You can then add songs to the queue and listen to them together.

# Remote Relay

[img]: /img/portfolio/IMG_20190519_011516.jpg

In my sophomore year of High School I made a remote relay.
I made this out of frustration because the many remotes I had to use at the time.
This remote relay could be controlled by a Progressive Web App.
It could learn IR codes and could be used to control a TV or LED strips.
The UI was basic but it worked.

# Smart RC Car

[img]: /img/portfolio/IMG_20190520_205415.jpg

In High School I made a smart RC car.
This RC car could be controlled over Bluetooth.
It connected to an Android App made in MIT App Inventor.
The car also had IR sensors that could be used to detect obstacles.
The car refused to drive into obstacles. And it would turn on the hazard lights if it was stuck.

My desk when retracted was always too dark to work on.
I installed a LED strip to fix this problem.

# Line Following Robot Chain

[img]: /img/portfolio/linefollowers.webp

This was a side project in High School.
The robots were made to follow a black line on a white background.
If the robot saw an obstacle it would stop and wait for the obstacle to be removed.
Like this the robots would also not collide with each other.
I ran the code on 3 robots simultaneously.

# RL & LC Calculator

[img]: /img/portfolio/IMG_20181013_160626.jpg

In my first year in Electronics I made a calculator for RL and LC circuits. This calculator could be used to calculate the frequency, inductance, capacitance, resistance and reactance of a circuit. This calculator was made with HTML and JavaScript.

# Digital Multi Meter

[img]: /img/portfolio/IMG_20180915_183240.jpg

Before I was an Electronics student I was an Engineering student.
Because of this I didn't have a real multimeter at home.
So I made one myself out of an Arduino and a 16x2 LCD.
This multimeter could measure voltage, current and resistance.

# Passion Project - PixelAdventure

[img]: /img/portfolio/wfiW155WGIBJAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg.png

This is a game I made in my free time.
It is a simple multiplayer game, there was no goal.
You could just walk around and talk to other players.
The game was made in JavaScript and used a NodeJS server.
It was hosted on a Raspberry Pi 3B+.
I always end up coming back to this project. And try to improve it.

# Animatronic Sesame Street

[img]: /img/portfolio/IMG_7771.jpg

In groups of 2 we had to make animatronics.
We made 4 animatronics from Sesame Street.
We had to make the animatronics from scratch.
I did the programming and electronics my partner made the faces in Solidworks.

In a group of 4 people we made a project for the ESA.
We made a project that took pictures of the earth from the ISS.
We then used the data from the pictures to detect and label water land and clouds.

# Rope Bridge Robot

[img]: /img/portfolio/ropebot.webp

In our engineering class we had to make a robot that could cross a rope bridge. This project was made in groups of 2. We used a Lego Technic battery and motor set to power the robot. We made customized gears in Solidworks so we could achieve a strong enough torque to cross the rope bridge. We mainly used lasercut wood for the shassis. Theres also lasercut plexiglass involved and the axles are made from PCV pipe.

Europe day 2016 I was one of the volunteers at the Popup Coderdojo.
This dojo was held in the city of Brussels at the European Parliament.
The Coderdojo stand was a big hit and we had a lot of kids come by.
I helped a lot of kids with a little introduction to JavaScript programming inside of Minecraft. All of this also speaking in English.
